total time spent

~ 12 hours

2 files..

old_index.html (day 1 about 4 hours in)
index.html (Final)

Usage:

1) download me

2) extract

3) open index.html in chrome (didnt do much cross browser)

Notes:

This is intended for FULL SCREEN APP.. please run it on full screen. Deved on 1440p monitor, anything less than 1080p may not be so good..

Navigations at the bottom, once a user is selected you may browse his/her genes/geneRegions from floating panels on left and right.

Genes of Interest will be highlighted in bright red with black text in contrast to the .. other color-coded a,t,g,c's.

Trackball is in this project but not activated (felt weird).

with more users, we can fit about 5 user cards at the bottom and not waste so much space.

cheers
